        countrysides begins their urbanization. Some people hold that we should deter the rural form this type of development. while others believe that it is necessary for us to foster this procession. I think that we should interfere the villages from the urbanization, because it destroies the environment and endanger people’s health condition.
         By urbanizing, our surroundings will be damaged, and it’s hard to recover. In the past, my hometown was a wonderful place, where covered by the flourish trees and clean river. However, when the urbanization started on the my village, it all changed. Water in the river become dirty and the tree of the wooden disappeared. rural in our country are facing the same problem, but we cannot stop the urbanization’s happen, because it is acted by the country's policy . In short, urbanizing will take our terrific hometown away from us, and we need to deter it.
           Besides, the urbanization  will be harmful to people's health. the urbanization is finished, and people who lives in this place have to find a job to earn his living in a company, because the urbanization makes them only can work for companies instead of working in a field. Unfortunately, during the whole day’s work, they seldom move or go out for a walk, but sitting in front of the computers. Consequently, the urbanization creating the sub-health status of people, severely affect people’s health. To be brief, the urbanization deeply impact on humans’ healthy condition.

          To sum up, although the urbanization can bring us about the life’s convenience and living quality, it  brings a substandard environment and healthy condition for us. So, let’s enjoy the non urbanization life, holding this situation forever!
